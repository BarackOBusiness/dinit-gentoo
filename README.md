# dinit-chimera

This is the core services suite for [dinit](https://github.com/davmac314/dinit)
as used by Chimera.

Requires [dinit-userservd](https://github.com/chimera-linux/dinit-userservd).

Some scripts have been adapted from Void Linux's `void-runit` suite as well as
from `dinit`'s example Linux setup.

Code adapted from `void-runit`:

* `crypt.awk`
* `modules-load`
* `seedrng.c`
* minor pieces of early oneshots
